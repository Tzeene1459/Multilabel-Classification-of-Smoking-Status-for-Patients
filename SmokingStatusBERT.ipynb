Urinary retention . 5. Bone marrow transplant in 2000 . 6. Appendectomy . 7. History of pulmonary embolism . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr. Chysfreierm is a 53-year-old man with Kappa lyte chain multiple myeloma admitted with pain , shortness of breath , fevers and weight loss . He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 1999 . He underwent radiation and VAD complicated by pulmonary embolus . This was followed by bone marrow transplant in 2000 . He relapsed and underwent IMIV-3 , Cytoxan and finally PS-341 , which brought his disease to excellent control during May to October , 2002 . In November he began to experience rectal pain , was diagnosed with a prolapsed hemorrhoid . He had a bout of appendicitis followed by surgery for his hemorrhoid in December . Repeat surgery was required for another hemorrhoid . The month of admission he had an anal fissure repaired and then began to have more significant problems with urinary retention requiring catheterization for control , although he had noticed some problems with urinary retention up to two months ago . On admission he complained of right lateral thigh , buttock , \\\" nerve \\\" pain . He complained of fevers , chills and night sweats and a 20 pound weight loss , dyspnea on exertion lasting less than five minutes . His last bowel movement was one week prior to admission . He has no chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or diarrhea . ALLERGIES : He has no known drug allergies . SOCIAL HISTORY : He is a former software engineer . He is married and has two children . FAMILY HISTORY : Noncontributory . His problem list is as per the problem list . PERTINENT PHYSICAL FINDINGS ON ADMISSION : VITAL SIGNS : Blood pressure 153/92 , pulse 102 , respirations 20 , temperature 99 degrees Fahrenheit , satting 93 to 94% on room air . GENERAL : The patient was awake and alert , in no acute distress . HEENT : Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light . His extraocular movements were intact . His oropharynx was somewhat dry , but otherwise clear . NECK : He had no lymphadenopathy . HEART : His heart was regular rate and rhythm without gallops , however , II-III / VI systolic ejection murmur was heard . LUNGS : His lungs were bilaterally clear to auscultation . ABDOMEN : His abdomen was benign . EXTREMITIES : There was no edema of his extremities . His strength was 5/5 throughout . Sensation was intact grossly . He had 2+ symmetric reflexes with down-going toes bilaterally . NEUROLOGIC : His cranial nerves were intact . LABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION : Sodium 133 , potassium 3.7 , creatinine 0.6 with a BUN of 5 , glucose 151 . Alkaline phosphatase was 392 . White count was 7 . Hematocrit was 24.6 . His INR was 1.3 with a PTT of 101 . Calcium was 8.4 , phosphate 2.8 , mag 1.8 . UA showed 30 to 40 red blood cells but had a negative dip stick . His chest X-ray showed elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with the colon of normal diameter , his new left rib fracture and soft tissue densities at the second rib and lateral sixth rib and then upper thoracic compression fracture . There were no complications of his admission . HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM : Problem number 1 , multiple myeloma . The patient was re-staged during his admission with a urine and serum electroimmunophoresis and a full skeletal survey . He also received a four-day Decadron burst . The patient had pain in the L3 distribution . His MRI of the spine showed no clear reason for the pain and thus , a pelvic CT was obtained showing a large right pelvic mass that likely was causing his leg pain . Radiation oncology was scheduled for next Tuesday to irradiate the mass . Urinary retention . Although there was a T5 compression fracture compressing the cord without signal change , there was no evidence that this lesion could be causing his urinary retention ; and it was felt that the pelvic mass more likely accounted for his urinary retention . Fevers . His blood and urine cultures were obtained and remained negative throughout admission . His chest X-ray did not reveal source of his fevers . The patient was placed on Levaquin . Shortness of breath . The patient had a V-Q scan on admission that was low probability for PE . The patient had no evidence of acute pulmonary embolus and his shortness of breath resolved over the course of his admission . The patient had a T5 compression fracture with cord deformity . Neurosurgery was consulted . No steroids were recommended . A brace was ordered to stabilize the spine when the patient was up more than 10 minutes . Surgical intervention per Dr. Jescneighagne was being evaluated and considered for the compression following his radiation therapy . Posterior fossa mass . This mass was found on a screening MRI of the head per neurosurgery . Radiation oncology also plans radiation to that lesion while he is getting radiation for the pelvic mass . The patient had no evidence of cerebellar dysfunction on discharge . DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : 1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3. Senna tablets two tabs p.o. b.i.d. 4.

OTHER PROBLEMS : 1. HYPONATREMIA , 1-13-94 . 2. PULMONARY EMBOLUS , 1-14-94 . 3. DIARRHEA , NAUSEA AND VOMITING , FEVER . 4. HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 . She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control . The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass . A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative . However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma . Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters . Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray . Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally . Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 . The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma . The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma . Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer . The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion . Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA . The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage . Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast . Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy . The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles . There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression . However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion . ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 . Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates . The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia . Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied . Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease . She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support . Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis . She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy . It was treated with gent and Cipro . Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis . In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions . In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine . The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 . She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting . We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia . UTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster . Status post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 . She had menarche at age 15 . She used the pill for five years in the past . She is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries . She has a history of easy bruis ability . She is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash . MEDICATIONS : MS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet . FAMILY HISTORY : Noncontributory . SOCIAL HISTORY : Married with two children . She worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children . She denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : A cachectic white female . T 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air . HEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light . Neck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . Lungs were clear . Chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus . Cardiovascular - Normal . Abdomen - Normal . There was no HSM . Extremities - Her left arm was very swollen . It was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips . There was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm . Neuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory . She also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower . Cranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact . Toes were downgoing . LABORATORY DATA : Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 . PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 . ALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 . Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 . UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria . Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia . In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall . The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea . When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics . So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her . Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined . She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done . Another major issue with this patient was pain control . She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion . So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management . One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 . After that the patient had minimal relief of pain . However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her . So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up . She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch . She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours . We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain . Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking . We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions . In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that . That has been stable . The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic . Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 . A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH . We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it . We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction . In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116. So that has really improved . We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day . On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump . Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE . So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s. Her INR is 2.3 . We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 . So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night . However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now . Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also . We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol . So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 . If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure . The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that . She is also a little dry . The patient is on oxygen . Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen . She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters . We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well . The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure . DISPOSITION : Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE : Fair . She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema . She is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care . Follow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks . The appointment has already been made . The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

IDIOPATHIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY SECONDARY DIAGNOSES : 2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY 3. HYPERTENSION 4. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE 5. BRONCHITIS 6. CERVICAL POLYPS CHIEF COMPLAINT : The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 . She was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation . Patient also received AICD . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation . Patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows : In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in Hispit , Delaware . Since that time the patient has been treated medically . In 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram . On 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at Retelk County Medical Center . Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus . Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin . Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 . Coronaries were completely normal . Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction . In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil . Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 . Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% . Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests . Furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission . Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers . The patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to Souland in Nixmont Bovo with increasing congestive heart failure . At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed . By report , in the interim since discharge from Retelk County Medical Center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications . Dring this hospitalization at Hahkellrick Hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest . She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block . She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off . She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to Retelk County Medical Center for further evaluation . The patient was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation . The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service . It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease . Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the Alllo Eino Hospital which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative . Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty . On 02/22/94 an EPS study was performed . The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation . Consequently AICD placement was recommended . Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 . Note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis . Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD . Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection . Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement . Thus , AICD placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis . There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement . By 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site . At this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 . It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to Vonamemp , LA via plane by herself . This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps . ALLERGIES : NKDA . MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER : Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , digoxin .125 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg q.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , dobutamine 2.3 mg per kilogram per hour , Xanax .25 mg prn , Beclovent 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil 2 puffs q.i.d. , K-Dur 20 mEq q.d. , magnesium oxide 400 mg t.i.d. and Colace 100 mg b.i.d. SOCIAL HISTORY : Positive tobacco history although the patient quit approximately 1 year ago . History of alcohol formerly 6 pack per day long-standing , however , the patient currently does not use alcohol . The patient lives with her daughter and is unable to work . FAMILY HISTORY : Positive for lung cancer and positive for hypertension . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : HEENT : Within normal limits . NECK : Supple with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally , negative for bruits . Jugular venous pressure approximately 8 cm , negative for lymphadenopathy . CARDIOVASCULAR : Regular rate and rhythm , II / VI systolic murmur , negative for L3 . Note that the S2 was greater than S1 . LUNGS : Clear to auscultation bilaterally with an inspiratory squeak at the left lower base . ABDOMEN : Positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended , negative for hepatosplenomegaly .

HOSPITAL COURSE : As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation . As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate . An EPS study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus . Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 . Hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement . Note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology . Cultures were negative . Debridement was negative for purulent discharge . Pathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection . The patient did well following the AICD placement . There were no intraoperative complications , and no postoperative complications . DISPOSITION : The patient is discharged to home in stable condition on 03/13/94 . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : At the time of discharge , the patient was on Coumadin 2 mg q.h.s. , K-Dur 20 mEq po q.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg po q.d. , Isordil 10 mg po t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg po q.d. , Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , Digoxin .25 mg po q.d. , Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d. , Beclovent inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. , Tylenol #3 1 tablet 30 mg po q. 2-3 hours times 1 day prn pain or discomfort .

He was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when he first noted diffuse abdominal pain exacerbated by defecation and accompanied by diaphoresis . Temperature of 102.7 was measured at home . He noted the onset of jaundice one day prior to admission , and then visited his primary care provider , Dr. Vas of Grandhdale who referred him to Daughtersvillshamen's Hospital for admission . The patient also noted the onset of diarrhea 3-4 times a day of yellow color without presence of blood . He had not eaten any raw foods or other likely causes of infectious gastroenteritis . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant only for hypertension . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : The patient has mild fever of 100.0 upon admission , otherwise stable . Patient was markedly jaundiced on admission with very mild right upper quadrant tenderness to firm palpation and no noted lymphadenopathy . Neurologic exam was benign and nonfocal . Of note , the patient 's platelets were noted to be 91 with an alanine-aminotransferase of 64 and an aspartate-aminotransferase of 85 . Amylase and lipase were both elevated with amylase of 193 and lipase of 55.6. A right upper quadrant ultrasound showed possibility of gallstones without ascites . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : The patient was admitted , diet was cautiously advanced . Abdominal computerized tomography scan was obtained and GI was consulted who recommended observation . The following day , the patient 's fevers had resolved and the jaundice was additionally resolving . Symptoms were felt to be attributable to possible past gallstone causing a brief episode of pancreatitis . ERCP was performed by Gastroenterology on the 27th , which showed no stones and normal cystic duct and normal gallbladder . Sphincterotomy was performed ; no evidence of biliary disease was observed . The patient was discharged on 08/28/00 in stable condition . Of note , the patient was empirically treated with Ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl upon admission for the possibility of ascending cholangitis . Blood cultures grew out E. Coli , pansensitive . Patient was transitioned to Levofloxacin , 500 mg . PO QD for two weeks , amylase , lipase and bilirubin and transaminases all trended down . The patient felt considerably better . The patient was discharged on Zantac , 50 PO BID , Levofloxacin , 500 QD for two weeks as mentioned and Mylanta PRN . Since cystic kidneys were noted on the abdominal computerized tomography scan , and the patient is to follow up with his PCP , Dr. Vas . The patient is also to follow up with Ophthalmology for an exam for retinal hemangioblastoma and the possibility of a head magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate for cerebellar hemangioma to consider the possibility of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome , no evidence of pheochromocytoma has been noted symptomatically . FOLLOW UP : The patient is to follow up with Dr. Vas . ___________________ MALCRIN COT , M.D. Electronically Signed MALCRIN COT , M.D. 11/29/2000 22:51 TR : fts DD : 11/02/2000 TD : 11/05/2000 10:26 A cc : MALCRIN COT , M.D. QUETSHA F VAS , M.D. NASA RUSSSID LINKEWEERTSJESCLEASK , M.D. [ report_end ]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Megacolon status post rectal surgery and biopsy ( positive ganglion cells ) 4/1/92 . status post surgical disimpaction 6/19/92 . Hernia repair and orchiopexy 07/30/88 . Hypospadias repair 06/92 . Hydronephrosis and ureteral blockage of the left ureter , status post repair 6/2/90 . The patient is also status post pyeloplasty 10/12/91 . Chronic otitis media status post PE tube placement times 7 . Spinal agenesis . Tethered cord with spinal cord tumor excision 1/31/91 . Seizure disorder . The patient is presently being weaned off Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol . MEDICATIONS : Phenobarbital 30 mg b.i.d. , Tegretol 100 mg b.i.d. , Iron 50 mg q. day , multivitamin 1 p.o. q. day , Senekot 1 tablet b.i.d. , FiberCon 1 to 2 times a day . Pavulon intravenous drip . 16 mg per kilo per hour and Morphine sulfate 3 mg per hour intravenous drip . The patient 's weight is 15 kilos ALLERGIES : The patient has no history of allergies . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from Capa An- Medical Center of Ohio on 07/20 for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations . The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations . On 08/10/90 the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures . The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on 02/92 . A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis . Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections . On 07/19/92 the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles . The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy . On 07/19/92 direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea . They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea . The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube . The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Asney Ewood Health Care in Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine . Dr. Fields was consulted and the patient was transferred by Ton Len N'ss Community Hospital to Ph University Of Medical Center Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. Fields on 07/20 in the p.m. The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite . HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM : 1. Respiratory : The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until 7/21/92 . The patient was brought to the Operating Room where bronchoscopy was done . The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords . The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too . Very mild . The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords . The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis . Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position . I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative . There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable . There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable . The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy . The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask . The patient generally breaths between 20 and 30 breaths per minute and is otherwise stable . Cardiac : The patient is otherwise stable . The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival . These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable . Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 . Fluids and Nutrition : The patient was initially NPO and then begun on Pediasure feeds the first two days of hospitalization . The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food . The patient generally does not drink much fluid . GI : From a gastrointestinal point of view please note on ______________ at 5 a.m. the patient was noted to be aspirating bits of cereal and juices via his trach tube . This was felt to be mild aspiration . The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing . Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds . The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress . The patient was made NPO on 7/25 a.m. Dr. Fields 's team is coming to evaluate the patient . Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future . The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days . KUB on 7/23 showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema . The patient last received enema on 7/24 in the p.m. HEM : The patient has generally been stable . His initial hematocrit was 31% . His hematocrit on transfer was 33% . The platelet count was 351,000 . The patient never received blood during the procedure . The estimated blood loss was minimal . Renal : The patient has always had good urine output with normal BUN and creatinine . Neurological : The patient has a history of of seizure disorder . He has been stable here . He is presently being weaned off his Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol by his Neurologist in Vanri , SC . Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 . The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future . Phenobarbital has been maintained by intravenous 30 mg b.i.d. Infectious Disease : The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in Mississippi . The patient was switched over to Ancef to cover for Staph and usual flora for possible pneumonia . The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 . Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable . The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative . The patient cannot be cathed as he has a recent hypospadias repair . The patient is still being maintained on Ancef at the request of Dr. Fields 's team . DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS : The patient will be transferred to Ral Medical Center in Saintarv on 7/25/92 by ambulance . The patient has a 3-0 Shiley in place that is stitched to his neck and also has trach ties in places . The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask . The plans per ENT are that the patient 's trach will not be changed for at least one months time . Dr. Fields will contact Dr. Roosekote as to probable plans . It appears that Dr. Fields wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time . The parents are being transferred back to Newstonpend to learn trach care and to set up homecare . If you have any questions please contact me .

IDIOPATHIC DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY SECONDARY DIAGNOSES : 2. DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY 3. HYPERTENSION 4. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE 5. BRONCHITIS 6. CERVICAL POLYPS CHIEF COMPLAINT : The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 . She was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation . Patient also received AICD . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation . Patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows : In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in Hispit , Delaware . Since that time the patient has been treated medically . In 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram . On 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at Retelk County Medical Center . Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus . Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin . Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 . Coronaries were completely normal . Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction . In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil . Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 . Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% . Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests . Furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission . Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers . The patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to Souland in Nixmont Bovo with increasing congestive heart failure . At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed . By report , in the interim since discharge from Retelk County Medical Center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications . Dring this hospitalization at Hahkellrick Hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest . She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block . She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off . She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to Retelk County Medical Center for further evaluation . The patient was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation . The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service . It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease . Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the Alllo Eino Hospital which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative . Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty . On 02/22/94 an EPS study was performed . The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation . Consequently AICD placement was recommended . Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 . Note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis . Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD . Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection . Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement . Thus , AICD placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis . There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement . By 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site . At this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 . It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to Vonamemp , LA via plane by herself . This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Type II diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps . ALLERGIES : NKDA . MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER : Captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , digoxin .125 mg q.d. , Lasix 40 mg q.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , dobutamine 2.3 mg per kilogram per hour , Xanax .25 mg prn , Beclovent 2 puffs q.i.d. , Proventil 2 puffs q.i.d. , K-Dur 20 mEq q.d. , magnesium oxide 400 mg t.i.d. and Colace 100 mg b.i.d. SOCIAL HISTORY : Positive tobacco history although the patient quit approximately 1 year ago . History of alcohol formerly 6 pack per day long-standing , however , the patient currently does not use alcohol . The patient lives with her daughter and is unable to work . FAMILY HISTORY : Positive for lung cancer and positive for hypertension . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : HEENT : Within normal limits . NECK : Supple with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally , negative for bruits . Jugular venous pressure approximately 8 cm , negative for lymphadenopathy . CARDIOVASCULAR : Regular rate and rhythm , II / VI systolic murmur , negative for L3 . Note that the S2 was greater than S1 . LUNGS : Clear to auscultation bilaterally with an inspiratory squeak at the left lower base . ABDOMEN : Positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended , negative for hepatosplenomegaly . EXTREMITIES : Negative for clubbing , cyanosis or edema , and 2+ pulses throughout . NEUROLOGICAL : Nonfocal . LABORATORY DATA : Sodium 141 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 93 , bicarb 34 , BUN 14 , creatinine .8 , glucose 155 , hematocrit 51.3 , platelet count 255 , white count 8.1 . Digoxin 0.9 . HOSPITAL COURSE : As mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation . As per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate . An EPS study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus . Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 . Hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to AICD placement . Note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology . Cultures were negative . Debridement was negative for purulent discharge . Pathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection . The patient did well following the AICD placement .

He was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when he first noted diffuse abdominal pain exacerbated by defecation and accompanied by diaphoresis . Temperature of 102.7 was measured at home . He noted the onset of jaundice one day prior to admission , and then visited his primary care provider , Dr. Vas of Grandhdale who referred him to Daughtersvillshamen's Hospital for admission . The patient also noted the onset of diarrhea 3-4 times a day of yellow color without presence of blood . He had not eaten any raw foods or other likely causes of infectious gastroenteritis . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Significant only for hypertension . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : The patient has mild fever of 100.0 upon admission , otherwise stable . Patient was markedly jaundiced on admission with very mild right upper quadrant tenderness to firm palpation and no noted lymphadenopathy . Neurologic exam was benign and nonfocal . Of note , the patient 's platelets were noted to be 91 with an alanine-aminotransferase of 64 and an aspartate-aminotransferase of 85 . Amylase and lipase were both elevated with amylase of 193 and lipase of 55.6. A right upper quadrant ultrasound showed possibility of gallstones without ascites . HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : The patient was admitted , diet was cautiously advanced . Abdominal computerized tomography scan was obtained and GI was consulted who recommended observation . The following day , the patient 's fevers had resolved and the jaundice was additionally resolving . Symptoms were felt to be attributable to possible past gallstone causing a brief episode of pancreatitis . ERCP was performed by Gastroenterology on the 27th , which showed no stones and normal cystic duct and normal gallbladder . Sphincterotomy was performed ; no evidence of biliary disease was observed . The patient was discharged on 08/28/00 in stable condition . Of note , the patient was empirically treated with Ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl upon admission for the possibility of ascending cholangitis . Blood cultures grew out E. Coli , pansensitive . Patient was transitioned to Levofloxacin , 500 mg . PO QD for two weeks , amylase , lipase and bilirubin and transaminases all trended down . The patient felt considerably better . The patient was discharged on Zantac , 50 PO BID , Levofloxacin , 500 QD for two weeks as mentioned and Mylanta PRN . Since cystic kidneys were noted on the abdominal computerized tomography scan , and the patient is to follow up with his PCP , Dr. Vas . The patient is also to follow up with Ophthalmology for an exam for retinal hemangioblastoma and the possibility of a head magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate for cerebellar hemangioma to consider the possibility of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome , no evidence of pheochromocytoma has been noted symptomatically . FOLLOW UP : The patient is to follow up with Dr. Vas . ___________________ MALCRIN COT , M.D. Electronically Signed MALCRIN COT , M.D. 11/29/2000 22:51 TR : fts DD : 11/02/2000 TD : 11/05/2000 10:26 A cc : MALCRIN COT , M.D. QUETSHA F VAS , M.D. NASA RUSSSID LINKEWEERTSJESCLEASK , M.D. [ report_end ]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Megacolon status post rectal surgery and biopsy ( positive ganglion cells ) 4/1/92 . status post surgical disimpaction 6/19/92 . Hernia repair and orchiopexy 07/30/88 . Hypospadias repair 06/92 . Hydronephrosis and ureteral blockage of the left ureter , status post repair 6/2/90 . The patient is also status post pyeloplasty 10/12/91 . Chronic otitis media status post PE tube placement times 7 . Spinal agenesis . Tethered cord with spinal cord tumor excision 1/31/91 . Seizure disorder . The patient is presently being weaned off Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol . MEDICATIONS : Phenobarbital 30 mg b.i.d. , Tegretol 100 mg b.i.d. , Iron 50 mg q. day , multivitamin 1 p.o. q. day , Senekot 1 tablet b.i.d. , FiberCon 1 to 2 times a day . Pavulon intravenous drip . 16 mg per kilo per hour and Morphine sulfate 3 mg per hour intravenous drip . The patient 's weight is 15 kilos ALLERGIES : The patient has no history of allergies . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from Capa An- Medical Center of Ohio on 07/20 for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations . The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations . On 08/10/90 the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures . The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on 02/92 . A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis . Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections . On 07/19/92 the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles . The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy . On 07/19/92 direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea . They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea . The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube . The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Asney Ewood Health Care in Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine . Dr. Fields was consulted and the patient was transferred by Ton Len N'ss Community Hospital to Ph University Of Medical Center Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. Fields on 07/20 in the p.m. The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite . HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM : 1. Respiratory : The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until 7/21/92 . The patient was brought to the Operating Room where bronchoscopy was done . The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords . The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too . Very mild . The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords . The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis . Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position . I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative . There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable . There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable . The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy . The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask . The patient generally breaths between 20 and 30 breaths per minute and is otherwise stable . Cardiac : The patient is otherwise stable . The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival . These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable . Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 . Fluids and Nutrition : The patient was initially NPO and then begun on Pediasure feeds the first two days of hospitalization . The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food . The patient generally does not drink much fluid . GI : From a gastrointestinal point of view please note on ______________ at 5 a.m. the patient was noted to be aspirating bits of cereal and juices via his trach tube . This was felt to be mild aspiration . The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing . Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds . The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress . The patient was made NPO on 7/25 a.m. Dr. Fields 's team is coming to evaluate the patient . Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future . The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days . KUB on 7/23 showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema . The patient last received enema on 7/24 in the p.m. HEM : The patient has generally been stable . His initial hematocrit was 31% . His hematocrit on transfer was 33% . The platelet count was 351,000 . The patient never received blood during the procedure . The estimated blood loss was minimal . Renal : The patient has always had good urine output with normal BUN and creatinine . Neurological : The patient has a history of of seizure disorder . He has been stable here . He is presently being weaned off his Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol by his Neurologist in Vanri , SC . Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 . The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future . Phenobarbital has been maintained by intravenous 30 mg b.i.d. Infectious Disease : The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in Mississippi . The patient was switched over to Ancef to cover for Staph and usual flora for possible pneumonia . The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 . Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable . The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative . The patient cannot be cathed as he has a recent hypospadias repair . The patient is still being maintained on Ancef at the request of Dr. Fields 's team . DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS : The patient will be transferred to Ral Medical Center in Saintarv on 7/25/92 by ambulance . The patient has a 3-0 Shiley in place that is stitched to his neck and also has trach ties in places . The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask . The plans per ENT are that the patient 's trach will not be changed for at least one months time . Dr. Fields will contact Dr. Roosekote as to probable plans . It appears that Dr. Fields wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time . The parents are being transferred back to Newstonpend to learn trach care and to set up homecare . If you have any questions please contact me .
